/*
Approach:
1. **Base Case Check:**
   - If `k` (the number of palindromes to construct) is greater than the length of the string `s`, return `false` because it's impossible to form more palindromes than the total number of characters available.

2. **Character Frequency Calculation:**
   - Create a vector `charCount` of size 26 initialized to 0 to store the frequency of each character in the string.
   - Iterate through the string `s` and increment the count for each character in the `charCount` vector based on its ASCII value (`c - 'a'`).

3. **Count Characters with Odd Frequencies:**
   - Initialize a variable `oddCount` to 0. This variable will track the number of characters in `s` that have odd frequencies.
   - Iterate through the `charCount` vector. For each character frequency, if it is odd (`count % 2 != 0`), increment `oddCount`.

4. **Check Palindrome Construction Feasibility:**
   - The minimum number of palindromes that can be constructed is equal to `oddCount` because each character with an odd frequency must be placed in a separate palindrome.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `oddCount`, return `true`, as it is possible to construct `k` palindromes. Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach leverages frequency counting and the properties of palindromes (where at most one character can have an odd frequency in a single palindrome) to determine the feasibility efficiently.
