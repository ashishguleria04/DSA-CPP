/*
- Problem: Count unique palindromic subsequences of the form "X_YX" in the string.

- Approach:
  1. Use two frequency arrays:
     - `before`: Tracks character frequencies before the current index.
     - `after`: Tracks character frequencies after the current index.
     
  2. Initialize `after` with the frequencies of all characters in the string.

  3. Traverse the string, treating each character as the middle (`Y`) of the palindrome:
     - Decrement its count in `after` since it's now processed.
     - For each character `X` ('a' to 'z'):
       - Check if `X` appears in both `before` and `after`.
       - If true, form the palindrome "X_YX" and store it in a set (to ensure uniqueness).
     - Update the `before` array to include the current character.

  4. The size of the set represents the total number of unique palindromic subsequences.

- Complexity:
  - Time: O(n * 26) â‰ˆ O(n), where n is the length of the string.
  - Space: O(26) for frequency arrays + space for the set of palindromes.
